Repo for adding resources to the Coding Bit Public Trello Board

The Coding Bits Public Trello Board is a collection of resources for entry level Ruby on Rails Developers. The collection are resources that I have found useful during my continuing journey to learn RoR. As I continue to learn I continue to add resources with that in mind I am always looking for new resources that can help the entry level developer take that next step or solve that one issue.

If you would like to use the board you can find it at: https://trello.com/b/jbISyy2k

If you would like to add to the board, make a pull request of get_resource_added.md.

Thank You.
